# AoE2ScenarioParser
This is a project for editing parts of an `aoe2scenario` file from Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition outside of the in-game editor. This project started as a way to edit triggers, conditions and effects using a not yet created scripting language but I realised quite early on a lot more will be possible.

# Progress
Current up-to-date progress can be found on the [Trello](https://trello.com/b/7SNm3gXj/aoe2-de-parser) board. 

## Features:
- Reading any `aoe2scenario` file from AoE2:DE.
- Writing said file back to an `aoe2scenario` file.
- Being able to add triggers using Python code.

## Bugs:
- None (?)
